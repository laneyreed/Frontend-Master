# Accessible Nav Bar
**An navigation bar menu that is responsive and accessible**
**This project demonstrates an accessible and responsive navigation bar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation bar is designed to be user-friendly for all users, including those who rely on screen readers and keyboard navigation.**

### Key features of this navigation bar include:
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Keyboard accessibility with focus trapping when the menu is open
- ARIA(Accessible Rich Internet applications) attributes to enhance screen reader support
- Overlay functionality to close the menu when clicking outside of it

**Feel free to explore the code and customize it for your own projects!**

**Each concept is demonstrated below a `TODO:` comment**
1. Start with this simple design using HTML and Internal CSS [here](./html/starter.html), or create your own
    - no need to clone just copy and paste into a HTML document and customize as desired
2. With the simple layout


- **TODO 1:** Skip to content link for screen readers and keyboard users
    - allows users to bypass repetitive navigation links and go directly to the main content of the page, improving accessibility and user experience
